## What is tmux?
* tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you use a single environment to launch multiple terminals, or windows, each running its own process or program

## I want to add this test and delete it later
Delete this!

## Explaining the key bindings
* `<Ctrl-b>` means "press the `Ctrl` and `b` keys simultaneously"
* `<Ctrl-R>` means "press the `Ctrl` and `R` (holding `<Shift>` key down) keys simultaneously"
* `<Ctrl-b> d` means "press the `Ctrl` and `b` keys simultaneously, then release, and then press `d`"
* If you see a command prefixed with `$` this is a terminal command
* If you see a command prefixed with `:` this is inside tmux

## Prefix
The Prefix is huge in Tmux. This is the key you press before pressing another key. The default `Prefix` is `<Ctrl-b>` but I changed the `Prefix` to `<Ctrl-a>` which adds the advantage of keeping your hands on the "home keys"

## Tmux default Prefix
* I turned mouse off (this makes navigating harder)
* Default Prefix is `<ctrl-b>`
* But I changed it to `<ctrl-a>` (home keys!)
* I used <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" target="_blank">Karabiner-Elements (A keyboard customizer for macOS)</a> to change my Prefix from the default `ctrl-b` to `ctrl-a` (see screenshot below)

* I love this change because it keeps my Prefix on <a href="https://medium.com/usevim/the-importance-of-the-home-row-f65a43dde1fd" target="_blank">the Home Keys</a>

## High level key bindings for Tmux commands
* [Resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) is a Tmux plugin
  * I recommend using Lua and packer to install this plugin
  * Once the lines are added to your nvim config you can install the plugin with `prefix + I` (note: that is a capital 'I')
  * Once installed you can save Tmux sessions with `prefix + <C-s>` and resurrect tmux sessions with `prefix + <C-r>`

## Adding ruby for tmuxinator
* `tmuxinator` <a href="https://github.com/guyhughes/tmuxinator" target="_blank">tmuxinator docs</a> is a simple tool you can use to define and manage different tmux configurations
    - You can use tmuxinator to create complex layouts when you open a tmux session. See the screenshot below for an example

![IMG complex tmuxinator layout](https://i.imgur.com/EMrVgcq.png)
* tmuxinator requires the Ruby interpreter (so you need to have that on your system)
    - Ruby is already on Mac
    - However if y ou plan to use Ruby for anything beyond tmuxinator it is strongly incouraged to install Ruby through RVM
    - I used [this site](https://kemalmutlu.medium.com/installing-ruby-on-rails-macbook-pro-m1-4272da855fb3)
* On the macOs M1 use iTerm and open it via Finder and check `Open using Rosetta` option

### Install ruby and rbenv

`$ brew install rbenv ruby-build`

```
# Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
$ echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
# Install Ruby
$ rbenv install 2.7.2
$ rbenv global 2.7.2
$ ruby -v
```

### Install tmuxinator
* Now you can install tmuxinator

`$ gem install tmuxinator`

## Troubleshooting
* ran into a strange problem with typing a character in tmux and many characters would be typed. It made tmux almost unusable - to fix it I used this tip - https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5931 and set escape-time from 0 to 50 milleseconds

```
When your .tmux.conf has the line set -sg escape-time 0, it happens.

But if I add the line set -sg escape-time 0 (I'm on Mac M1) The strange characters appear. I think it is because of the 0s. Finally I change it to 50ms (500ms default).
```
- this fixed it for me (and refreshing tmux)
